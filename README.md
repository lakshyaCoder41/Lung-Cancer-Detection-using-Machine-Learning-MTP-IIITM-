Cancer is one of the major causes of deaths worldwide. According to WHO 2020, lung
cancer is responsible for nearly 2.735 million deaths. So, the early detection and classification of lung cancer is one of the most priority research in the field of biomedical health
informatics. In this initial phase of research different feature extraction techniques has
been reviewed. First set of techniques involved handcrafted feature extraction based on
texture, shape and structure. Second set of techniques technique involved deep learning
frameworks for deep feature extraction from lung cancer CT images. Based on extensive
study on lung cancer detection and classification, research gaps and problem definition
of this research work are highlighted. In future, in contrast to handcrafted features the
significant improvement in conventional classifier performance and complex feature extraction using deep learning techniques and fusion of both and their comparative analysis
is planned as compared to existing state-of-the-art works.

This repository contains all the code related to handcrafted feature analysis and deep learning feature analysis of LIDC IDRI standard dataset.
